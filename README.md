# Keras Deep Learning Model
### Building a Concrete Compressive Strength Model using Deep Learning Keras Library

1. Building and optimizing a regression model using Keras deep learning library
Building a base model
Normalize features/predictors value
Increase epochs/iterations
Increase hidden layer
FINAL MODEL: 3 hidden layers with 10 nodes, ReLu activation function, adam optimizer, mse loss function and 100 epochs
Model Evaluation: Mean Squared Error

2. Building a regression model using Keras deep learning library Version 2.0
FINAL MODEL: 7 hidden layers with 25 nodes, ReLu activation function, adam optimizer, mse loss function and 250 epochs
MODEL EVALUATION: Mean Squared Error = 31.35 R^2 = 0.89

3. Predict a new value using pre-train model
